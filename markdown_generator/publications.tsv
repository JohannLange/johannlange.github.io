2017-06-09	Design and Adaptive Depth Control of a Micro Diving Agent	IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L)	This letter presents the depth control of an autonomous micro diving agent called autonomous diving agent (ADA). ADA consists of off-the-shelf components and features open-source hardware and firmware. It can be deployed as a testbed for depth controllers, as well as a mobile sensor platform for research or in industrial tanks. We introduce a control law that is based on the feedback linearization method and enhanced by an adaptive fuzzy algorithm to cope with modeling inaccuracies. The proposed depth controller is computationally light enough to run on ADAs embedded hardware. In experiments performed in a wave tank, the adaptive fuzzy scheme shows the ability to deal with both depth regulation and depth profile tracking. ADA is even able to hold on to dynamic isobars despite external disturbances. We demonstrate that under the influence of waves, ADA describes orbital motions similar to water particles.	W. M.

2019-09-10	Obstacle avoidance-driven controller for safety-critical aerial robots	Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH)	The goal of this thesis is to propose the combination of Control-Barrier-Functions (CBF) with Model-Predictive-Control (MPC) resulting in the novel Model-Predictive-Control-Barrier-Function (MPCBF). It can be shown, that the performance of the MPCBF surpasses the performance of the CBF due to the increased time horizon of the MPC. Moreover, the MPCBF was applied to a quadrotor, a system strongly in need of fast and predictive control. Using the MPCBF, the quadrotor was able to avoid obstacles, which the CBF failed to avoid due to the relative speed of the obstacle. The results of this work are experimentally validated.	J.
